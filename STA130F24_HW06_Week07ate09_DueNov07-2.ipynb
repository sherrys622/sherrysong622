    "A reasonable characterization of STA130 Homework is that it simply defines a weekly reading comprehension assignment. \n",
    "Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.\n",
    "However, rather than reading a textbook, STA130 Homework is based on ChatBots so students can interactively follow up to clarify questions or confusion that they may still have regarding learning objective assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Communication is a fundamental skill underlying statistics and data science, so STA130 Homework based on ChatBots helps practice effective two-way communication as part of a \"realistic\" dialogue activity supporting underlying conceptual understanding building. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will likely become increasingly tempting to rely on ChatBots to \"do the work for you\". But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

As seen in the introductory figure above, if the delay of the geyser eruption since the previous geyser eruption exceeds approximately 63 minutes, there is a notable increase in the duration of the geyser eruption itself. In the figure below we therefore restrict the dataset to only short wait times. Within the context of only short wait times, is there evidence in the data for a relationship between duration and wait time in the same manner as in the full data set? Using the following code, characterize the evidence against the *null hypothesis* in the context of short wait times which are less than  *short_wait_limit* values of *62*, *64*, *66*.<br>\n"

A low p-value here would suggest evidence against the null hypothesis, implying that waiting time does have a measurable effect on duration within this limited dataset.\n",
